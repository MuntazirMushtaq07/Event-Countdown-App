- **React.js** (Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`)
- HTML5 `<input type="datetime-local" />`
- CSS3 (modern gradients, shadows, animations)
- LocalStorage (for saving events)

> 💬 Some styling and code structure were enhanced using **ChatGPT** — for learning, exploring UI ideas, and making the app extra polished. The logic, components, and structure were implemented by me.
